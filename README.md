# Doing - People Management App

- What is worker X doing? 
- What is your progress on a specific task? 
- Need help?

These are typical questions that a team leader asks himself and does not always get an answer. Or get them when it's too late.

With these questions as a starting point, this web and mobile application called doing was born. 

Due to this digital solution, 
- the team leader can know what each worker is doing,
- what their progress is, 
- assign tasks remotely, 
- identify if they need help and, 
- it allows him/her to identify the most efficient workers.
