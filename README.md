# Doing - People Management App

- What is worker X doing? 
- What is your progress on a specific task? 
- Need help?

These are typical questions that a team leader asks himself and does not always get an answer. Or get them when it's too late.

With these questions as a starting point, I designed this web/mobile application called doing, which won the first prize in the Competition of Digital Innovation of Bank Santander in 2016.

Due to this digital solution, 
- the team leader can know what each worker is doing,
- what their progress is, 
- assign tasks remotely, 
- identify if they need help, 
- identify the most efficient workers.

In addition, the digital solution allows each worker to share their task planning/evolution.
